### Dynamic Web Applications Project: Build a Pinterest Clone.

My [Eye See](https://eye-see.herokuapp.com/ "Eye See").

#### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://midnight-dust.glitch.me/# and deploy it to Heroku.

##### Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new - Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

##### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can login with Twitter.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
